               My name is Stephen Fagbelu. I am Nigerian currently studying Comuter Science at Caleb University. I was
               born on the 11th of January, 2004. I am a perfectionist of some sort and I always give the best result
               posible when it comes to a project. I am a very friendly according to my peers and i find it very easy to
               work with multiple people in a team.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               Aside developing websites and problem solving, I also enjoy reading, music and playing chess. Tech has
               always been a big part of my life and from a very young age, I made up my mind to involve myself in tech
               as a choice of work which infuluenced my choice to study computer science.
            </p>

               My journey started in May 2023, during my internship at a tech company.
               Over the short period of six months, I was able to gain the skill to develop functional websites that are
               not only SEO optimized, but also give top notch user experience when a customer views the pages. I love
               to build projects and that's all there is to me mostly.
